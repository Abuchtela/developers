# TechNERD Program

The TechNERD program consists of technical support specialists helping developers building in the Optimism Collective.
[Season 5 Details](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/151).

## Contribution Tracking

The TechNERD contribution tracking is done by the individual TechNERD and reviewed by the steward(s) of the program.
This will help with RPGF applications and ensure individual contributors are actively helping our technical ecosystem.
To start tracking your contributions:

1. Create their own sub-directory in the [contributors sub-directory](/community/support/technerd-program/contributors)
1. Create a sub-directory for the season you're participating in
1. Log your contributions each week
1. Open a PR after each week, following the [templated format](community/support/technerd-program/contributors/template/season-5/yyyy-mm-dd-to-yyyy-mm-dd.md)
   1. Provide a link to the contribution
   1. Effort classification, as specified below
   1. Anyone who assisted with resolution
1. The steward will review and validate the PRs and keep track of overall contribution scores.

### Effort Classification

|    Size      | Points | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| S            | 1      | Quick and straightforward issues that can be resolved with minimal effort and in a short time. Create an issue for a documentation update and/or a PR for a small update.                                                   |
| M            | 3      | Moderately complex issues that require more investigation, troubleshooting, and a moderate amount of time to resolve. A moderate contribution to updating an existing piece of documentation.                               |
| L            | 5      | Complex problems that demand a significant amount of time, extensive research, and potentially collaboration with contributors outside of the TechNERD program. Creating a whole new page of documentation.                 |
