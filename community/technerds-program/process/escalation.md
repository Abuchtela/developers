### ðŸ’¡Improving Ticket Escalation from TechNerds to Internal Team

This document aims to identify how the TechNerds can better escalate tickets to the internal team on Slack (`#supnerds-x-optimism` channel). To enhance our ticket escalation process, please follow these guidelines:

- **Clear Subject Line:** _Use a subject line that summarizes the issue effectively._
- **Concise Question:** _Along with the issue, include a specific question from your perspective. This helps the team focus their efforts without needing to dig through the entire problem._
- **Problem Description:** _Briefly describe the problem youâ€™re facing, including any research or effort youâ€™ve already invested._
- **Attachments:** _Include any relevant files or screenshots that could aid in understanding the issue._
- **Issue Source:** _Provide your thoughts on where you believe the issue might be originating._
- **Add Ticket Emoji (ðŸŽ«):** _React to any escalations with the ticket emoji (ðŸŽ«) to automatically log them into our internal tracking system._
- **Tagging:** _Please tag me (Kehinde Yusuf ) in all escalations. I will ensure the issue is addressed promptly._
- **Follow-Up:** _If you havenâ€™t received a response within escalation period (24hr), please bump the message for increased visibility. Feel free to tag me anytime, I have my notification on always_

Hereâ€™s a template that can be copied and filled out:
