- Lets make it suck (~15m)
- Lets make it great (~15m)
- Put it into a plan (~15m)
- Reflect / Conclude (~5m)

## Reflection

This was an excellent first brainstorming session. Here is the resulting [Figjam Board](./TechNERD%20Brainstorming%20Session%200.png). Our session resulted in a few high level categories that are summarized below.

### Resources

We've identified:

- The importance of having clean central technical documentation that is up to date.
- Create resources for Support and Tech NERDs to help answer developer questions
  - FAQs of previously answered questions for SupNERDs
  - Troubleshooting guides and run books for TechNERDs
- Creating a training system to continuously educate and welcome new TechNERDs
- GPT bot for our documentation

**soyboy's notes:**

- We're undergoing a docs overhaul to address the first point
- OP Labs is prioritizing improving docs and creating new resources for support contributors to use
- GPT bot would be a nice to have, but would need to ensure correctness

### Collaboration and communication

- Different communication channels are important. 
- There is a desire for more collaboration with the core team at OP Labs
- Support developers by connecting them with other teams (i.e. ambassadors, delegates, investors, and badgeholders)

**soyboy's notes:**

- Currently we're using Discord for IM and the developer forum for developer support questions. I'm weary of expanding it further than that at moment, but open to it if it addresses a need.
- Collaborating with the core engineers requires a healthy balance because of their focus on developing the core software. However, we can improve on just having soyboy as the relayer of these questions.
- Some of these communication channels exist others do not. We can do better on building them out and making them more visible.
  
### Providing more support

- Importance of providing prompt and accurate technical support
- Expanding support to help on GitHub issues in our repositories

**soyboy's notes:**

- This can be addressed by scaling the program and providing resources on how to respond, even when you don't know the answer.
- Expanding support will be crucial and more feasible as we scale the program.

## Next steps

- Take the information we've gathered and add it to our strategic plan for the next round. 
- Schedule the next session
