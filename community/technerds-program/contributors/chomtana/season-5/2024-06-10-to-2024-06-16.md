Setting hardfork timestamp before current timestamp will prevent system transaction from `0x0000...0000` that uses to upgrade the contract since the block designed to hold these transactions have already been mined without these system transactions. That's why the derivation or any weird bug come in

op-node/rollup/derive/attributes.go

```go
	var upgradeTxs []hexutil.Bytes
	if ba.rollupCfg.IsEcotoneActivationBlock(nextL2Time) {
		upgradeTxs, err = EcotoneNetworkUpgradeTransactions()
		if err != nil {
			return nil, NewCriticalError(fmt.Errorf("failed to build ecotone network upgrade txs: %w", err))
		}
	}
```

```go
// IsEcotoneActivationBlock returns whether the specified block is the first block subject to the
// Ecotone upgrade. Ecotone activation at genesis does not count.
func (c *Config) IsEcotoneActivationBlock(l2BlockTime uint64) bool {
	return c.IsEcotone(l2BlockTime) &&
		l2BlockTime >= c.BlockTime &&
		!c.IsEcotone(l2BlockTime-c.BlockTime)
}
```

If we set the timestamp to before the recent block, `c.IsEcotone(l2BlockTime - c.BlockTime)` will return true because the previous block is considered an Ecotone block. Since the activation point has been passed, there will never be a non-Ecotone block again, and `IsEcotoneActivationBlock` will always return false.
