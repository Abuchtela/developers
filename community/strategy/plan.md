# Strategic Planning

Our strategic plans are defined by objectives, goals, non-goals, success criteria, implementation plans, and owners.

- The **objective** should be a specific outcome that we want to achieve. These should be high-level but not too fluggy.
- Each objective should have a number of **goals**, and each goal should have **success criteria**, **impilementation plans**, and (where appropriate) **owners**.
- The **success criteria** should be a set of measureable assessment methods. We should be able to look at the criteria and definitively know whether it was achieved.
- The **implementation plan** is a set of reasonably granular steps that indicate how you can achieve the goal.
- In some cases, it makes sense to assign an **owner** to a goal, even if the owner merely has oveersight in getting it done.
