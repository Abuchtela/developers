# Vision

The following document is an ideal state for community technical support to be in. Something the TechNERD program and our community should aim for. This initial pass is a brain dump and is incomplete.

## Responses

Developers should receive immediate quality responses from members of the TechNERD program. If the first responder doesn't have the answers immediately, they should be able to provide a relevant and supporting resources to the requester. If those resources do not exist, it should be noted, and they should be created.

## Resolution

Developers who make responses should be supported continuously until their request has been resolved. The answers they seek should be detailed, clear, and also concise. The answers should be written in a way, that repeat questions can be answered by simply pointing to a previous thread.

## TechNERD Program

The program should be structured in a way where wannabe TechNERDs can complete training asyncronously, prove they've done so onchain, and start supporting our technical community. When the next season of governance starts, new applicants should have onchain proof they've completed the training and evidence that they've already begun contributing to the community.

## Processes

Support should have well defined, simple, and open source processes that our TechNERDs can utilize. These should include:

- How to make a first response
- How to answer/close a thread
- How to troubleshoot a node
- How to troubleshoot an op stack chain
- How to deploy a smart contract
- How to escalate questions
- How to redirect non-technical questions
- How to turn questions into new documentation or resources
- How to collect feedback to improve the core protocol
- How to address outdated or incorrect documentation
