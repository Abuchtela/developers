# Account Abstraction Tooling 

Smart wallets are the next step in usability in web3, which is defined by the [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) proposal. In simple terms, [“account abstraction”](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/account-abstraction/) effectively replaces the basic [EOA (Externally Owned Accounts)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/) with a smart contract based account, which can support more complex features, including gas fee sponsorship, extensible functions such as security rules, and transaction batching for faster processing.

## Owl Protocol

[Owl Protocol](https://owlprotocol.xyz) is complete dev suite and API for web3, but also includes a modular account abstraction wallet API. This allows anyone to utilize advanced smart wallet features such as the paymaster for gas sponsorship, or transaction bundler through a simple REST API. Devs can also deploy a fully compatible ERC-4337 smart wallet for any user with just an email, making onboarding users easier than ever before.
