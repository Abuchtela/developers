# Blockchain Indexers

Blockchain data is not easily queryable by default. Indexing tools help with extracting data from blockchain node, transforming it in a way that is understandable by human or computers, and loading it to a database or any other destination for querying.

## Flair

[Flair](https://flair.dev) is a real-time and historical custom data indexing for any evm chain.

It offers reusable **indexing primitives** (such as fault-tolerant RPC ingestors, custom processors and aggregations, re-org aware database integrations) to make it easy to receive, transform, store and access your on-chain data.

To get started, visit the [documentation](https://docs.flair.dev) or clone the [starter boilerplate](https://github.com/flair-sdk/starter-boilerplate) template and follow the instructions.

## Envio

[Envio](https://envio.dev) is a full-featured data indexing solution that provides application developers with a seamless and efficient way to query real-time and historical blockchain data for any EVM. 

Envio [HyperSync](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/hypersync) is an indexed layer of the Optimism blockchain for the hyper-speed syncing of historical data (100x faster than JSON-RPC). What would usually take hours to sync ~100,000 events can now be done in the order of less than a minute. 

Designed to optimize the user experience, Envio offers automatic code generation, flexible language support, multi-chain data aggregation, and a reliable cost-effective [hosted service](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/hosted-service).

To get started, visit the [documentation](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/overview) or follow the [quickstart](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/quickstart) guide.

## Covalent
[Covalent](https://www.covalenthq.com/?utm_source=optimism&utm_medium=partner-docs) is a hosted blockchain data solution providing access to historical and current on-chain data for [100+ supported blockchains](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/?utm_source=optimism&utm_medium=partner-docs), including [Optimism](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/optimism/?utm_source=optimism&utm_medium=partner-docs).
​
Covalent maintains a full archival copy of every supported blockchain, meaning every balance, transaction, log event, and NFT asset data is available from the genesis block. This data is available via:
​
1. [Unified API](#unified-api) - Incorporate blockchain data into your app with a familiar REST API
2. [Increment](#increment) - Create and embed custom charts with no-code analytics
​
**Use Covalent if you need:**
* Structured and enhanced on-chain data well beyond what you get from RPC providers
* Broad and deep multi-chain data at scale
* Enterprise-grade performance
​
