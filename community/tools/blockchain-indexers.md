## Flair

[Flair](https://flair.dev) is a real-time and historical custom data indexing for any evm chain.

It offers reusable **indexing primitives** (such as fault-tolerant RPC ingestors, custom processors and aggregations, re-org aware database integrations) to make it easy to receive, transform, store and access your on-chain data.

To get started, visit the [documentation](https://docs.flair.dev) or clone the [starter boilerplate](https://github.com/flair-sdk/starter-boilerplate) template and follow the instructions.

## Envio

[Envio](https://envio.dev) is a full-featured data indexing solution that provides application developers with a seamless and efficient way to query real-time and historical blockchain data for any EVM. 

Envio [HyperSync](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/hypersync) is an indexed layer of the Optimism blockchain for the hyper-speed syncing of historical data (100x faster than JSON-RPC). What would usually take hours to sync ~100,000 events can now be done in the order of less than a minute. 

Designed to optimize the user experience, Envio offers automatic code generation, flexible language support, multi-chain data aggregation, and a reliable cost-effective [hosted service](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/hosted-service).
