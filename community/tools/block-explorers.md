Custom layouts are currently supported for the following types of addresses:
- Tokens: chart, trading activity, flows, liquidity, large transfers
- EOAs: token flows, funding sources, trading activity
- NFTs: chart, top holders, trading activity, collection viewer
- Lending Markets: tvl, rates, flows, positions
- Liquidity Pools: chart, activity, liquidity depth
- Stablecoins: supply over time, lending markets, flows
- LSTs: stake over time, rates, peg strength
- ERC4626 (yield tokens): yield, deposit flows
- & More
