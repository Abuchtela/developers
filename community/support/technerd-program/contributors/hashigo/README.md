Hi, my name is hashigo. I am involved in the world of crypto as a hobby and issue transactions on the blockchain every day. I work as an engineer at a Japanese SaaS company. I am also extremely honored to be able to contribute to Optimism, which is working on building digital democratic governance and tackling Ethereum scaling.
