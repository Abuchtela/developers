This involved providing feedback on issues with the OP-Sepolia official bridge UI, Super-Relayer, L2 to L1 Message Relayer, Blockscout, and SuperchainBridge, all stemming from the latest upgrade of OP-Sepolia. However, the issues don't seem to be perfectly resolved. I completed seven withdrawal transactions for users in two batches using the Optimism SDK.
