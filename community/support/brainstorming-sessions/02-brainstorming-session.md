# Brainstorming Session #2

date: 2024-01-10 @ 15:00 UTC
attendees(discord & github username):
- soyboy_vegan, @sbvegan

## Purpose

This session is to determine what contributions will be tracked in the TechNERD program so RPGF applications are simplified.

## Agenda

- Introduction / Purpose / Attendence (~5m)
- Explain the t-shirt sizing process proposal (~15m)
- Collect feedback and suggestions (~15m)
- Concolude (~5m)

### Proposal

Soyboy is proposing that TechNERDs track their individual contributions. They will make weekly PRs to this repository with a document containing their contributions and an effort size attached to each one. The steward of the program will review the contributions and make sure the self assessment aligns with the effort classification. The points will be a running score of that season's contributions and will simplify the retroactive public goods funding applications in the future. 

#### Process

1. Each TechNERD creates their own subdirectory to track their contributions.
2. Every week a TechNERD will track their own contributions and compile them into a document.
3. They will fill out the contributions' detail with a short description, link, and an effort classification (see table below for details on the sizing)
4. At the end of the week, TechNERDs create a PR to their subdirectory.
5. Program steward reviews, merges, and records the points of the TechNERDs.
6. Repeat 2-5 until the end of the season.

##### Effort Classification

The effort classification is a way where we can measure impact individuals are having on the technical community.

|    Size      | Points | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| S            | 1      | Quick and straightforward issues that can be resolved with minimal effort and in a short time. Create an issue for a documentation update and/or a PR for a small update.                                                   |
| M            | 3      | Moderately complex issues that require more investigation, troubleshooting, and a moderate amount of time to resolve. A moderate contribution to updating an existing piece of documentation.                               |
| L            | 5      | Complex problems that demand a significant amount of time, extensive research, and potentially collaboration with contributors outside of the TechNERD program. Creating a whole new page of documentation.                 |
| XL           | 8      | Highly intricate issues that require substantial time, deep expertise, and possibly coordination across multiple external contributors or extensive debugging. Creating a whole new page of highly technical documentation. |
