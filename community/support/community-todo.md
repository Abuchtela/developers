# Community TODO List

## Identify how we can divide our community into teams :heavy_check_mark:

Vee has done an excellent job of this. We have different contribution paths that help contribute to improving the Optimism Collective:

- [Support NERDs](https://community.optimism.io/docs/contribute/contribution-path/NERD-req/) provide support to the Optimism Discord, helping users with questions, and pointing people in the right direction.
- [Ambassadors](https://community.optimism.io/docs/contribute/contribution-path/Ambassador-req/) are highly values aligned with Optimism and are of course highly Optimistic! 
- [NumbaNERDs](https://community.optimism.io/docs/contribute/contribution-path/numbaNERDs/) program is designed to ensure that there is always high quality analytics and transparency around grant spending for delegates. 
- [Governance delegates](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/delegate/) play an active role in Token House governance.
- [Governance citizens](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/citizens-house/#) plan an active role in Citizen House governance.
- [Translators](https://community.optimism.io/docs/contribute/contribution-path/translators/#) help us truly decentralize by helping us embrace the diversity of our community.
- The [TechNERDs](https://community.optimism.io/docs/contribute/contribution-path/techNERDs/) program is designed to improve the technical support available to developers in the Optimism Ecosystem.

### TechNERDs and Developer Support

This repository is focused on developer support. Thinking into the future, our TechNERD program can scale into specialties. The OP Stack is at least made up of:

- Node Operators
- OP Stack Chain Developers
- Application Developers

These are the high level personas, so it would be good to have TechNERDs that can support in all of these domains.

## Ensure that teams can communicate clearly and effectively :heavy_check_mark:

We have comms channels setup in our Discord channel.

## Attract a diverse range of contributors to our community to get involved and contribute to our goals :heavy_check_mark:

We have an incredible diverse group of contributors. The translators alone support 20+ languages and our Discord server has many active language groups.

## Build an environment conducive to our wider goals :heavy_check_mark:

Our teams have been created and now we're moving in the direction of scaling and increasing decentralization.

## Define the scope of each team, and help team members understand that scope :heavy_check_mark:

We have clearly defined contributor paths that are outlined above.

## Understand the extent and range of collaboration between our teams



## Produce a Code of Conduct :heavy_check_mark:

- [Rules of Engagement 2.0](https://gov.optimism.io/t/rules-of-engagement-2-0/5728)
- [Code of Conduct](https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct/5751)
